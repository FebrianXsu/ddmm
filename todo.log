This is an unordered list of feature ideas I plan to work on in the future.
It may help developers decide if there's something in this project they could help me with.
Until I get someone to work with, my motivation is going to be low, and progress slow.
Even someone who understands how it works, but doesn't actually work on the code, would be insanely helpful.
Anyways, my cry for help aside:




standardize the messages with actual templates instead of adding a template for every type of messages
  example: have a message, error, help, warning, settings, etc. template that take parameters instead of a changeColor and thisBroke template

change the logging levels around to make it more clear what's going on if the user dosen't set a custom log level

add a setup portion that allows a first time user to configure their settings without having to do it the nerd way through code

make an installer for this project

handle imports... somehow... that lets newbs actually import the files (maybe just leave instructions like drop folders in /imports)

fix all the "NTS" bugs or features in comments (i think i can do most of them, there's only like 8)

setting for enabling/disabling auto-acknowledgement of dm messages

add a freekin help command ffs, it's not that hard
  commands should have an export detailing their name, usage, and description
  also show the imported packages with !help "package name" to get each one's help menu
  require that imports contail a help files
  write a help method for imports that allows the importing of these help files

Working on this now!
user input boxes
  custom emojis!
    two sets of controller buttons as squares like the regional indicators
    XBOX et al. A: green, B: red, X: blue, Y: yellow (just recolor the regional indicators) and an X to cancel
    Play Station: X: blue, Cirlce: red, Square: pink, Triangle: teal (actually custom icons) and an X to cancel <-- Decided to go with this one

  add an input box method that takes three-four parameters (title, ['opt1','opt2',null,'skipped opt3'], options?, callback)
    callback gets called with 0-3 indicating what button was pressed and a -1 for a timeout or close (might make timeout -2 or something to distinguish)
    timeout is specified as options {timeout: ms, deleteOnTimeout: true}

auto translation
  run messages through a filter to check what  language is is, if it differs from the recipient langauge run a popup

  Message might be in "language here" would you like to translate it to "other language?"
    A Translate
    B Don't translate this message
    X Don't translate any messages for this user
    Y Translate to a different language

  if a message is translated a message should be shown regarding the ability to auto-set a channel language

add a language select command
  set their language: !language theirLang
  set both languages: !language theirLang myLang

add a timezone feature
  add the ability to store the time of a given user such that a !time command can show what time it is for them
    !time: It is currently 69:69 in TIMEZONE
    planned on having an analog clock image be generated using an API to put in the embed (would be a nice touch)

add a status command
  just shows the status of the user

ability to create a channel the receives custom pings from a guild channel
  for example receiving the raid status notifications from pub halls and shatters server
  from just the user Funman

ability to emoji an image or create an emoji from a guild emoji
  !emoji <name> <url>
  !emoji <name> <guildid> <emojiname>

  if a message is just :name: then an image should be sent in place of it if it's in a relayable channel
  on option to bypass this in a specific channel should be allowed for example a group chat with friends
  another option to bypass this should be allowed through editing the code with a warning that it voids the stealth aspect
  (this is done to keep people who don't understand the risk of changing it out, also because I think it's a bad idea to change)
  (maybe I won't actually add this, who knows)
  

I think I got this one taken care of now actually!
FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY TO HANDLE THE DDMM MODULE!!!!!
  adding a custom unofficial temp ddmm module to the node_modules folder is a BAD idea!!!
  do it a better way in the future please!!!
  no like, seriously think of something, anything

add a command to send a message on a delay, like a goodnight message at a certain time
  !timesend 7:32 pm Goodnight!

change the way profiles are stored to use a sqlite database
