# Description
This is just a quick description, nothing too informative
This is a discord bot that creates a guild used to act as an intermediary between you and a dm channel
Now this is great and all, but what does it actually allow?
Having this allows us to actually filter out specific messages and do things base on them
Say for example send a note for all messages starting with a specific character
Or run a commands starting with a specific character
All without the person you're talking to having to see it
Better customization of the way you talk to people
I plan to write the code in such a way that anyone who wants to should be able to understand what's going on
Which will hopefully allow for people like you to write your own commands and message templates and more
And even better, we can package large amounts of cool changes into "modpacks" that we can distruibute for others
