Since there is no documentation for how to do this I'm going to quickly write this text file explaining how to write imports

Basically it's like this:

imports
`-package name
  |-commands
  | `-command.js
  `-messages
    `-message.js

That's the layout of a simple package. It adds the command "command" and the message template "message"
These files are to be formatted EXACTLY the same as the files in /commands/assets and /messages/assets
They will just be pulled in as if they were part of those folders whenever the bot starts up

I know this isn't incredibly descriptive, but I'm sure it should be enought to help those trying to figure it out along
If you still need help, my email and Discord are in the bottom of the readme.
Feel free to shoot me a message, I won't be bothered at all. I'm just a normal dude.
